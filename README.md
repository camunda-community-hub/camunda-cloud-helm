## Installing Charts

Follow [the instructions in the Camunda Platform documentation](https://docs.camunda.io/docs/self-managed/zeebe-deployment/kubernetes/index/) to install the Camunda Platform to a K8s cluster.

Check the repo branch for more technical details:
[camunda/camunda-platform-helm](https://github.com/camunda/camunda-platform-helm)

## Configure Charts

Helm charts can be configured by using extra values files or directly via the `--set` option.
Ensure to check out the [Camunda Platform Helm Charts Readme](https://github.com/camunda/camunda-platform-helm/blob/main/charts/camunda-platform/README.md) for more information.

Example to enable the Prometheus ServiceMonitor for Zeebe:

```sh
helm install <RELEASE_NAME> camunda/camunda-platform --set zeebe.prometheusServiceMonitor.enabled=true
```

## Uninstalling Charts

You can remove these charts by running:

```
helm uninstall <RELEASE_NAME>
```

> Notice that all the services and pods will be deleted, but not the Persistence Volume Claims which are used to hold the storage for the data generated by the cluster and Elasticsearch. In order to free up the storage you need to manually delete all the Persistent Volume Claims. You can do this by running:

```
kubectl get pvc
```

Then delete the ones that you don't want to keep:

```
kubectl delete pvc <PVC ids here>
```

Or delete the related Kubernetes namespace, which contains the resources.

## Deprecation of zeebe charts

With the creation of the Camunda Platform Helm charts (previously known as `ccsm-helm`),
the old `zeebe-*` charts have been deprecated. This means they are no longer part of the repository
or maintained. The packaged charts are still available for download.

The following charts are deprecated:

 * zeebe-full-helm
 * zeebe-cluster-helm
 * zeebe-operate-helm
 * zeebe-tasklist-helm

The new `camunda-platform` chart is a full replacement of `zeebe-full-helm` and replaces (contains) all other charts as sub-charts.
All sub-charts in `camunda-platform` are by default enabled.

Check the [migration guide](https://github.com/camunda/camunda-platform-helm/blob/main/MIGRATION.md) for more details.
