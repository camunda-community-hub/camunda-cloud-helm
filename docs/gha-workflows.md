# Docs: GitHub Actions Workflows

In this repo, we have many [GitHub Actions workflows](../.github/workflows) for different aspects
of the CI pipelines.

## Integration tests

The most important workflow is the [main integration workflow](../.github/workflows/test-integration-main.yaml),
where each Camunda component can reuse that workflow in their CI pipelines to ensure that
each component works as expected within the Camunda as a whole.

To embed the Camunda Helm chart integration tests in your GHA workflow, you need to use
the following:

```yaml
deploy:
  name: Helm chart Integration Tests
  uses: camunda/camunda-platform-helm/.github/workflows/test-integration-main.yaml@main
  secrets: inherit
  with:
    identifier: dev-console-sm
    extra-values: |
      global:
        image:
          tag: 8.2.10
      console:
        image:
          tag: xyz
```

Adding that will run Camunda Helm chart integration tests and add the deployment URL
in your repo (the URL will show in the PR or in the GH deployment section).

> **Note**
> The default behavior in the integration tests workflow is to deleted the test resources 
> after the test is finished. To keep the deployment you need to set `persistent: true`.
> **However**, even it's persistent, the resources will be deleted frequently to save costs
> and you need to rerun the workflow again when you need it.
